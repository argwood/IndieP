    "While the genre tags of each Steam game are accessible through Steamfront, the Steam API only provides a list of *all* available apps and no way to filter through them efficiently. A few alternative user-made APIs offer a wider variety of API features and could be filtered by genre, but as they are user-maintained and not always online, I chose to avoid these alternatives for this initial step and make sure our data comes directly from the main source (though we will use one user-made API, SteamSpy, later to collect data on estimated game sales/popularity since as far as I know there's no other way to get this information). Rather than make an API request for every single app (~70,000 requests) and check if it fits our genre, it will be more efficient to scrape a list of Indie games from Steam's online store: \n",

There's a total of 27,271 results at the time of writing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned to love (and hate) [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for all my prior web scraping projects, but for this project I've chosen to use the simpler and elegant [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) which will have a much easier time crawling through the 1,085 pages of results while also providing more flexibility since Steam updates their store frequently (plus, I've never used it and I like trying new things!). The ability to easily control a rate limiter for Scrapy is also a plus, since I want to ensure that the scraper remains well-behaved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial data collection, I scraped the following features for each game, as they are universal, easy to understand, and all accessible without needing to follow additional links (thus increasing the number of requests):\n",

    "* Url:\n",
    "* Title:\n",

The AppID, however, is a unique identifier and will be used to distinguish between data points throughout."

For example, you can see the first 5 instances of this below, but there's actually quite a few of these! In all cases, the first AppID listed is the game, and those following it are additional media. Since we only want the games and aren't interested in the DLC or soundtracks (in fact, we'll later collect just a \"yes or no\" answer as to whether the game has DLC, etc), we want to keep only part of these strings up until the first comma (we'll likely use this technique again later in the project for creating new features out of existing ones). Then, we'll want to check for duplicates again."
