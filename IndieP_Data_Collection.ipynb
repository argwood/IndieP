    "If you haven't been to a video game convention such as PAX (the Penny Arcade Expo) before, let me paint a picture for you. After you push through the thousands of fans and cosplayers crowding around the massive Nintendo, Sony, Ubisoft or Square Enix booths with hundred-inch flat screen TVs and LEDs flashing from signs hanging off the ceiling, at the very back of the convention hall is the Indie Mega Booth, where developers of around 80 indie games are chosen to showcase their work and get feedback from con-goers. And then, maybe upstairs, in another corner of the show floor, are 10 more indie games highlighted as the PAX 10, the indie games of the year that have been designated the \"best\" by some committee. But what do they mean by \"best\"? What factors go into determining which of the thousand games released each year will succeed, which will be remembered for years to come, which will fade away with time, and which will never even make it into the (albeit somewhat faded) spotlight?\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everyone has a sense of what big name games have been successful over the years, even if you aren't a hard-core gamer - Overwatch and Fortnite both had their moments of fame not too long ago, and there was Minecraft, Final Fantasy, and World of Warcraft before that - but indie games are a whole different world. How many people outside of that industry can tell you which indie game was the most successful last year? In the world of indie game development, there's no massive corporation deciding what kind of game to make based on what their analytics department has told them will sell the most copies. Instead, there's just a few nerds (maybe a programmer, an artist and a writer) with a cool idea and the skills to create a product out of it. "

    "\n",
    "**This project will be split into 4 parts:** First, we will collect a messy dataset of all of the games in the \"Indie\" genre of the [Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/about/). Then, we will clean up the data, decide which features to keep, and create a high-quality dataset suitable for analysis and as input for Machine Learning algorithms. Next, we will analyze our data by exploring the correlations between features to see what we can learn without using Machine Learning. Finally, we will create a training set and test set from our data, and create a Machine Learning framework to measure \"success\" of a game. In this final section, we will first address what metrics may be used to measure success, and what Machine Learning algorithms are best suited for the job at hand. "

First, we will scrape a filtered list of Indie games from Steam's online store to get basic information such as the title and AppID, which is the unique identifier for each game (or other medium). We will then use the Steam Store API to get as much information as we can about each game in our list. Lastly, since the Steam Store doesn't provide information about how many (active or inactive) users each game has, we will use an external API called SteamSpy, which has this information readily available."

    "While the genre tags of each Steam game are accessible through Steamfront, the Steam API only provides a list of *all* available apps and no way to filter through them efficiently. A few alternative user-made APIs offer a wider variety of API features and could be filtered by genre, but as they are user-maintained and not always online, I chose to avoid these alternatives for this initial step and make sure our data comes directly from the main source (though we will use one user-made API, SteamSpy, later to collect data on estimated game sales/popularity since as far as I know there's no other way to get this information). Rather than make an API request for every single app (~70,000 requests) and check if it fits our genre, it will be more efficient to scrape a list of Indie games from Steam's online store: \n",

There's a total of 27,271 results at the time of writing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned to love (and hate) [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for prior web scraping projects, but for this project I've chosen to use the simpler and elegant [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) which will have a much easier time crawling through the 1,085 pages of results while also providing more flexibility since Steam updates their store frequently (plus, I've never used it and I like trying new things!). The ability to easily control a rate limiter for Scrapy is also a plus, since I want to ensure that the scraper remains well-behaved.\n",
    "\n",

For example, you can see the first 5 instances of this below, but there's actually quite a few of these! In all cases, the first AppID listed is the game, and those following it are additional media. Since we only want the games and aren't interested in the DLC or soundtracks (in fact, we'll later collect just a \"yes or no\" answer as to whether the game has DLC, etc), we want to keep only part of these strings up until the first comma (we'll likely use this technique again later in the project for cleaning up and transforming our messy data, as well as creating new features out of existing ones). Then, we'll want to check for duplicates again."

In addition to cleaning, in Part 2 we will decide which categories we want to keep in our main dataset, and combine the information from Steam and SteamSpy."
