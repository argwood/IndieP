    "While the genre tags of each Steam game are accessible through Steamfront, the Steam API only provides a list of *all* available apps and no way to filter through them efficiently. Alternative user-made APIs such as SteamSpy offer a wider variety of API features, but as they are user-maintained and not always online, I chose to avoid these alternatives. Rather than make an API request for every single app (~70,000 requests) and check if it fits our genre, it will be more efficient to scrape a list of Indie games from Steam's online store: \n",

There's a total of 27,271 results at the time of writing this.\n",

    "I've learned to love (and hate) [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for all my prior web scraping projects, but for this project I've chosen to use the simpler and elegant [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) which will have a much easier time crawling through the 1,085 pages of results while also providing more flexibility since Steam updates their store frequently (plus, I've never used it and I like trying new things!). The ability to easily control a rate limiter for Scrapy is also a plus, since I want to ensure that the scraper remains well-behaved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial data collection, I scraped the following features for each game, as they are universal, easy to understand, and all accessible without needing to follow additional links (thus increasing the number of requests):\n",

    "* Url:\n",
    "* Title:\n",
    "* Release Date:\n",
    "* Price:\n",

The AppID, however, is a unique identifier and will be used to distinguish between data points throughout."
