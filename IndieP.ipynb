But what is \"best\"? What factors go into determining which of the thousand games released each year will succeed, which will be remembered for years to come and which will fade away?"

Alternative user-made APIs such as SteamSpy offer a wider variety of API features, but as they are user-maintained and not always online, I chose to avoid these alternatives. Rather than make an API request for every single app (~70,000 requests) and check if it fits our genre, it will be more efficient to scrape a list of Indie games from Steam's online store: \n",

The ability to easily control a rate limiter for Scrapy is also a plus, since I want to ensure that the scraper remains well-behaved.\n",
